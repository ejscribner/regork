Regork!
Project By Elliot Scribner
CommandLineTable.java Adapted from https://www.logicbig.com/how-to/code-snippets/jcode-java-cmd-command-line-table.html for printing tables

Regork Starts at the Main Menu-

       Please select your user type:
       -----------------------------
       [1] Manager
       [2] Data Checker


You can chose a manager, who can then search for products to find which suppliers stock it, check Regorks inventory, and search for manufacturers of specific products

       Main Menu > Manager
       Please select an option from the menu:
       --------------------------------------
       [1] Search products and look up stock by supplier
       [2] Check Regork inventory
       [3] Search for manufacturers


You can chose a data checker, who can view anomalies with shipping and offering inconsistencies, where manufacturer is different from shipper or manufacturer does not offer the product.
The data checker then provides support to fix the data anomaly.

       Main Menu > Data Analyst
       Please select an option from the menu:
       --------------------------------------
       [1] View and fix shipping inconsistencies
       [2] View and fix offering inconsistencies

The final option is to place an order for a new product for the Regork store.
The Ordering interface allows users to check Regork Inventory, search for manufacturers of a specific generic product, and place orders for new products.

       Main Menu > Ordering
       Please select an option from the menu:
       --------------------------------------
       [1] Check Regork Inventory
       [2] Find Manufacturers
       [3] Order new stock

Throughout the program each menu is displayed with a breadcrumb to indicate where in the program the user is:

       Main Menu > Data Analyst > Offers Anomaly Found


For all interfaces plenty of data works for testing and is easy to find with searches.

For compilation, a Makefile has been included in the ejs320 directory, which can use the following commands:

       make        -  compile java code
       make jar    -  create a jar file, and move it out to top level directory (as project specifies)
       make clean  -  clean up extra .class and .jar files

The jar process uses a manifest file in the config directory to point to the proper main class and class path
